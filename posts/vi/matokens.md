Bạn sẽ nhận được gì khi sở hữu những đồng aToken sinh lợi nhuận này và đặt chúng vào Matic Network? Tất nhiên là cùng lý do việc sở hữu maToken rổi!

Trang này sẽ là trang nối tiếp của trang [aToken](/atokens) Trước đây, chúng ta nhận về cho mình những đồng aToken. Giờ đây, ta sẽ thích thú khi chuyển đổi chúng thành những đồng maToken và biến chúng thành tài sản thế chấp để có thể triệu hồi những người bạn Aavegotchi!

## Converting aTokens into maTokens

First, head over to the [Bridge to Matic](https://aavegotchi.com/bridge) on the Aavegotchi DApp.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/matokens/bridge-to-matic.png" alt = "Aavegotchi Bridge to Matic" />

Next, click on the token image (circled in red below) to open a dropdown menu of tokens. At this moment, only three aTokens are supported: (1) aUSDC, (2) aDAI, and (3) aWETH.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/matokens/select-atoken-to-convert.png" alt = "Aavegotchi Bridge to Matic" />

After selecting the token, key in the amount you want to transfer to Matic. Using aUSDC as an example, key in the amount you would like to transfer to Matic Network in the box highlighted in red.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/matokens/amount-to-transfer-to-matic.png" alt = "Aavegotchi Bridge to Matic" />

Once you have keyed in the desired amount, click the "Approve Transfer" button. Wait for the transaction to go through on Ethereum.

After the Approve transaction goes through, click the "Transfer to Matic" button. Wait for this transaction to go through on Ethereum as well.

After you have done that, give it 10 minutes or so for your maTokens to appear in your wallet.

If you are using Metamask and would like to learn how to configure Matic Network on it, do check out the [Matic Guide](/matic) for step-by-step instructions as to how to do so.

## Staking maTokens into Aavegotchis

Okay, I've gotten myself some maTokens. What now?

Good work fren.

The next step is to purchase a [portal](/portals) using [GHST](/ghst). Portals could be purchased in the Aavegotchi DApp (link will be provided at launch) or on the [Secondary Markets](/marketplace) such as Opensea. Once you've gotten your hands on a precious portal, it is time to begin the summoning process. Upon opening the portal, you will be presented with 10 Gotchis, each with a randomized required maToken/collateral. Here's where the maToken you have acquired comes in. Stake it in the Gotchi that has the same collateral type and bring your fren to life!

For a more detailed explanation of the portal-opening process, check out our [portals](/portals) page.
