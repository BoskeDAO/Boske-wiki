Aavegotchi “missions” are a fun way to get a great understanding of the Aavegotchi project. Most are simple tasks (with the exception of just one
 that requires a bit more thought) and can be done whenever time permits and in any order you choose. As you complete each one, you’ll be leveled up 
by our Aaprentices, until you reach full Aagent status! Just be sure to hop in to Mission Control before mainnet launch, as our Aagent program will 
only run until then. Upon mainnet launch, all Level 10 Aagents will receive a complete Aagent wearable set exclusively for Aavegotchi Aagents.

**MISSION 1:** Comment in the Aavegotchi Litepaper

**MISSION 2:** Invite one fren to the Discord

**MISSION 3:** Add a sentence or two of your thoughts about the project to the Aavegotchi Community Pitch paper

**MISSION 4:** Retweet us with why you love Aavegotchi, and tag two frens

**MISSION 5:** Ask a question in our Telegram

**MISSION 6:** Use our testnet to buy testnet (not real) GHST from the testnet bonding curve (which does not require KYC - the real bonding curve does,
 but you can complete all missions without KYC). This is where you’ll suddenly become an expert on using testnets if you haven’t before, and will 
feel super smart helping everyone who comes after you.

**MISSION 7:** Vote on an Aavegotchi governance proposal

**MISSION 8:** Meme-time! Create an Aavegotchi-themed meme in any language you like.

**MISSION 9:** (the hardest one) Write a short article or make a short video about Aavegotchi (300 words for articles, or 30 seconds for videos). 

**MISSION 10:** CREATE AN AAVEGOTCHI (on testnet) using our Aavegotchi builder, adopt your Gotchi as your avatar (for 48 hours), and share your 
creation with the rest of the Aavegotchi fam!

&nbsp;

Congratulations fren, you’re an Aavegotchi Aagent! <img src="/missions/tinyagent.png"> **MISSION 11** is incoming - but, there won’t be many more 
missions as mainnet launch is imminent. Join us while you can - <a href="https://discord.com/invite/NPwnWB6">head over to our Discord to get started!</a>
