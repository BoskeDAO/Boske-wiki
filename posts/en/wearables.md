Wearables are an important component of the Aavegotchi game. Besides endowing your Aavegotchi with a sense of fashion, wearables also boost the Aavegotchi's traits and rarity score, enabling them to perform better in [minigames](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/minigames), as well as in [rarity farming](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/rarity-farming). 

This page contains detailed information about every wearable that has been confirmed in the Aavegotchi game.

## Key 

Aavegotchis have four traits that can be modified by wearables. 

* AGG = Aggressiveness
* NRG = Energy
* SPK = Spookiness
* BRN = Brain Size

The traits of "Eye Color" and "Eye Shape" cannot be modified by wearables.

*Note: Negative values do not mean the trait is getting "weaker". Aavegotchi traits are distributed on a bell curve, so the extremes (0,1) and (99,100) are actually the best!*

See [Traits](/traits) for more about this topic.

## Wearables BRS

Wearables can be equipped or unequipped at any time. Equipping/unequipping wearables may affect the [overall rarity](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/rarity-farming#base-rarity-score) of an Aavegotchi:

## LINK Themed Set

Distributed via an exclusive, limited-edition Raffle in November 2020, these LINK-themed wearables celebrate Aavegotchi's partnership with Chainlink, specifically our use of Chainlink VRF to ensure that Aavegotchis have verifiable, provably random traits.
