Xavier Iturralde is one of the Crypto Art scene’s most accomplished artists and entrepreneurs. His distinct pixel art work has earned him the attention (and sales volume) of NFT traders on OpenSea and Rarible. His innovative $PIXEL token was among the very first social tokens to take hold and demonstrate that NFTs tied to social tokens is a model with legs. His passionate followers are yet another cause for the fomo around Aavegotchi’s all-star team.

Nick Mudge is one of Ethereum’s most accomplished solidity developers. The ERC998 composables standard was authored by Mudge and is among the most important aspect of the Aavegotchi game, allowing a “parent” NFT to equip and carry “child” NFTs with them. More recently, Mudge has headed Ethereum research and development for what has been dubbed the Diamond Standard. This standard offers major breakthroughs for upgradeable contracts and is quickly being adopted by governance focused DAOs.
