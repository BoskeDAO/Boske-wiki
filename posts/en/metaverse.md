Welcome, fren! You’ve stumbled upon the Aavegotchi Realm - the classic, two-dimensional, pixelated wonderland where Aavegotchis live, work, and play. This is where you’ll 
be able to interact with all aspects of Aavegotchi life - and even build some of it yourself! In the Aavegotchi Realm, you can:

**Interact with other Gotchis**

Say hello! Visit your Aavegotchi frens and make new ones.

**Play Mini-Games**

Enter your Gotchi into competition! Level up your Aavegotchi when you rack up wins in all kinds of different metaverse games.

**Vote in the DAO**

Make your voice heard in the Aavegotchi Realm. Head to the metaverse governance building to cast your vote for the future of the Aavegotchi!

**Find a Babysitter and More**

As the ecosystem grows, you’ll be able to choose a special someone to look after your Aavegotchi when you’re away. Since 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/186zOapKeHNNJ9y8LIByQQ64rs0eJUlEF/edit#heading=h.2g1uoi1shr1d">kinship</a> is an important aspect of Aavegotchi care, you’ll be able to find these types of services and more in the Aavegotchi metaverse.

<p style="font-size:25px;"><b>How Do I Get My Own Land?</b></p>


In the Gotchiverse, you’ll also be able to contribute your own creations to the Aavegotchi experience! **REALM parcels** will be purchasable in the Aavegotchi store. You’ll be able to decorate your parcel via the Aavegotchi 
scene builder, and even add dApps to your land that can be used to interact with all kinds of other smart contracts. If that weren't enough,
REALM parcels can also be **enhanced by staking GHST to unlock new features.** 

Can't wait to see you in the Realm, fren! <img src="/metaverse/aavegotchiwave.png" width="70" height="60">
