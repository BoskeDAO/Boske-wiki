A bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines a relationship between price and token supply. Here’s an example of a bonding curve, where currentPrice = tokenSupply²:

This bonding curve says that price increases as the supply of the token increases. In the case of an exponential curve such as the one above, the growth rate accelerate as the number of tokens minted increases.

When a person has purchased the token, each subsequent buyer will have to pay a slightly higher price for each token, generating a potential profit for the earliest investors. As more people find out about the project and buying continues, the value of each token gradually increases along the bonding curve. Early investors who find promising projects early, buy the curve-bonded token, and then sell their token back can earn a profit in the future.
