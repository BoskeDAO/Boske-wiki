## Introduction

The GHST token is the base currency of the Aavegotchi realm. GHST is an ERC-20 token running on the ethereum blockchain. Here is the contract details: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x3F382DbD960E3a9bbCeaE22651E88158d2791550">https://etherscan.io/token/0x3F382DbD960E3a9bbCeaE22651E88158d2791550</a>. Beware of any token registered at a different adress.




## Buy/sell mechanisms
There are basically 2 ways to buy GHST tokens :
<ul>
  <li>With KYC & DAI: from the bonding curve <a href="https://aavegotchi.com/curve">https://aavegotchi.com/curve</a>. Buy here and fund directly the Aavegotchi development (the DAO governs how to deal with the DAI collected in the treasury). </li>
<br>
  <li>Exchanges: here is a list of exchanges where you can do that: <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aavegotchi#markets">https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aavegotchi#markets</a>. If GHST is not listed yet on your favourite exchange, it is your duty to spam their support team until they fix it</li>
</ul>
  
## What can I do with the GHST token?
A few ideas if you're bored jut hodling your GHST:
<ul>
  <li>Earn raffle tickets for a chance to win wearables: <a href="https://aavegotchi.com/stake"> Stake your GHST</a> to earn FRENS, <a href="https://aavegotchi.com/shop"> Convert your FRENS</a> to raffle tickets, <a href="https://aavegotchi.com/raffle"> Enter the raffle</a> and pray the holy VRF frog to be <a href="https://aavegotchi.medium.com/anon-and-the-green-ticket-5776969b3a69">as lucky as this anon</a></li>
  <li>Earn ETH : our frens at opensea have made things easy for your to buy and sell NFTs. <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/aavegotchi-frens-raffle-tickets">Raffle tickets can be sold </a>, <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/aavegotchi-wearable-vouchers">Wearables can be sold</a>, and of course Aavegotchis themselves will be saleable</li> 
  <li>Soon... summon an Aavegotchi. You might want to summon an Aavegotchi to play Aavegotchi. Buy a portal for 100 GHST and chose 1 out of 10 Aavegotchis randomly generated. Mainnet sooooon, test it on <a href="https://rinkeby.aavegotchi.com/portals">https://rinkeby.aavegotchi.com/portals</a></li>
  <li>Soon... buy wearables, consumables & collectibles. Your Aavegotchi has high fashion standards, make him feel special and he will give it back to you. Ever heard of rarity farming? [Aagent Mission: find & add the relevent wiki link]</li>
  <li>Soon... earn more GHST. 80% of the GHST collected will be redistributed to the Aavegotchi players. Take part in the DAO, rarity farm or by play mini-games to get your share of these tasty GHST.</li>
  <li>Soon... earn the REALM. Stake GHST and unlock parcel tokens within the REALM. REALM is a 2D pixelated metaverse for Aavegotchis, where Aavegotchis can encounter each other, participate in mini-games, call smart contracts, and participate in governance of the AavegotchiDAO. In addition to building out their parcel visually using a parcel editor, REALM holders will also be able to call smart contracts directly from their parcels, unlocking an entire new universe of possibilities.</li>
</ul>
