Tokenomics? Who even cares? WeN mOoN?? wEN GHST $5???

We hear you, Moonbois. But if you’re planning to invest in a project like GHST, it’s important to think about how the broader ecosystem works.

That’s precisely what Tokenomics is – understanding a particular token or coin’s network from its genesis to management, with the ultimate aim of incentivizing positive behaviour in the network.

GHST, Aavegotchi’s native governance token, will be distributed in two main phases. These are the initial token distribution phase, and later on through governance rewards and rarity farming.



**Phase 1: GHST’s Token Distribution**

In this phase, GHST was distributed in three stages. These were the private sale, pre-sale and public bonding curve sale.


**The Private Sale**

Size: 5, 000, 000 GHST Price: 0.05 DAI / GHST


The private sale was held in August 2020. Anyone who performed KYC and met a 20k DAI minimum can join. The funds raised during this round were allocated to Pixelcraft Studios, the company behind Aavegotchi, to ensure the successful development of the Aavegotchi game.


**The Pre-Sale**

Size: 500, 000 GHST Price: 0.1 DAI / GHST

The GHST Pre-Sale was held on 14 September 2020, with a time limit of 14 days or whenever the supply sold out, whichever came first. All Level 6 Aagents who had performed KYC by the aforementioned date were eligible to purchase GHST at this stage.

To conduct the sale, a snapshot of all Level 6 Aagents at the time was taken. This was then cross-checked with those who performed KYC. Then, a special “Verified Level 6” badge was assigned to all eligible participants in the Discord. These participants were then added to a special discord channel, where links to the presale were posted.

The funds raised here were used to bootstrap liquidity in the Token Bonding Curve reserve pool, at a reserve ratio of 100%.

Participants of the Private Sale and Pre-Sale will have their GHST tokens vested over a period of one year, beginning from the close of the Pre-Sale round. After 180 days, an initial release equivalent to roughly 50% of the total amount will be released, followed by a drip release of the remaining tokens over the next 185 days.

For more details on this, read on in the Aavegotchi Whitepaper and Community Update #4.


**Public Bonding Curve Sale**

As our frens would say, the curve never ends! For more information on the mechanics of the curve, view BONDING CURVE SECTION LINK.

There is no limit on the supply of GHST in this round, and no limit on the time. The price opened at 0.2 DAI/ GHST, and fluctuates along the curve. There is no lockup in this round either – tokens can be claimed straight away from the curve.

Anyone who participated in KYC and had their address whitelisted by the Aavegotchi team is able to purchase straight from the curve.

Funds raised from the Curve will be available to Pixelcraft Studios via a tap mechanism controlled by GHST token holders. More information about the mechanism can be found at https://fundrasing.aragon.black .


**Ecosystem Fund**

The Ecosystem fund consists of 1, 000, 000 GHST locked according to the same schedule as the Private and Pre-Sale rounds. Unlocked funds can be deployed via proposals made to the AavegotchiDAO V2.0 and above, for legitimate use cases such as funding development by non-Aavegotchi core team members, promotion and marketing of AavegotchiDao, as well as any other use case the AavegotchiDAO deems useful.


**Team Fund**

The Team Fund consists of 1, 000, 000 GHST locked according to the same schedule as the Private Round. However, once funds have been fully unlocked, they will be distributed according to a 3-year vesting schedule, and the remaining funds will be locked into a new vesting contract for another two years, and drip-released to the Aavegotchi core team.

Team funds are primarily used to incentivize core Aavegotchi team members to contribute with their full effort to the project, as well as to compensate external advisors.



**Phase 2: Governance Rewards and Rarity Farming in the Ecosystem**

More information on governance rewards and rarity farming can be found under RARITY FARMING SECTiON LINK + DAO LINK.

As a quick point of reference though, here’s a handy diagram that provides an overview of the system.

**Final Words**

One of the best parts about the crypto-verse and why you constantly see the addition of new players is this – it’s not a zero sum game. There’s the chance for all of us to make gains together, especially in a DAO. The question is, how we can best bring that about. Understanding the tokenomics of a project provides us with a good starting point.

Keep reading, and keep playing. See you on the moon soon, Aagent.
