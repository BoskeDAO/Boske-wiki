Aavegotchi raffle tickets and wearable vouchers can be traded between players in various marketplaces.

Currently, [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) is the most accessible marketplace where trades take place. In the future, Aavegotchi will host their own internal marketplace for gamers to trade among themselves.

As more Aavegotchi assets become available, there will be more categories of assets that are available for trading (e.g. portals, the Aavegotchis themselves, etc).

## OpenSea Tutorial

Raffle Tickets refer to the tickets that are used to participate in Aavegotchi Raffles. They come in one of 6 types: (1) Common, (2) Uncommon, (3) Rare, (4) Legendary, (5) Mythical, and (6) Godlike. Visually, they look like the following image.

All 6 types of Raffle tickets share the same contract address: 0x93eA6ec350Ace7473f7694D43dEC2726a515E31A

To purchase them off [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), key in the search term "aavegotchi FRENS raffle tickets" in the search bar on OpenSea. Select the same keywords that pop up from the dropdown menu (circled in red below).

Navigate to the type of Raffle ticket you are intending to purchase.

Using Godlike Raffle Tickets as an example, ensure that there is a "Verified Contract" blue tick mark next to the OpenSea collection title (circled in red below).

Next, scroll down the page, and check the Chain Info subsection. Compare the Contract Address to verify if it matches with the Raffle Tickets Contract Address (0x93eA6ec350Ace7473f7694D43dEC2726a515E31A). If they are similar, you are good to go.

## Warnings

It's not fun to spend your hard-earned money for fake wearables, so when buying on Opensea and other secondary marketplaces, make sure to exercise caution. Remember, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is!

* Always double-check that the contract address for the items are coming from the correct contract addresses.
* If you're unsure about something, go to the [official Aavegotchi Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NPwnWB6), where there's always frenly Aapprentices ready to help!
