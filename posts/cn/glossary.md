If you've just begun exploring the world of DeFi, welcome to this corner of the internet! This glossary aims to provide you with some information that will hopefully help you wrap your head around some DeFi basics. If you're completely new to this space, you might also want to check out other guides such as X and X, to help boost your understanding further.


This glossary will also provide you with an overview of some terms you can expect to see when navigating the Aavegotchi world, and general NFT space.


When you're done reading this and hopefully have a better understanding of these terms, feel free to hop over to the ONBOARDING SECTION and dive into ecosystem proper.

## DeFi

"DeFi" stands for **De**centralized **Fi**nance. It can be thought of as an ecosystem of applications and protocols that provide similar services to traditional financial institutions (ie, lending, borrowing, and accruing interests from saving, amongst others). However, there is one key difference - DeFi aims to do this in a decetralized manner with no middle man.


That means no banks taking a cut of your potential returns or providing you with negative interest rates. That also means no central point of failure where the entire system could collapse, or be subjected to a set of rules decided and implemented by a small group with concentrated power.


At the time of writing (December 5 2020), the Total Value Locked in Defi stands at 14.24B USD.

**Key Terms**

**APY** APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. This is the real rate of return earned on the savings you have deposited into a protocol, taking into account the effect of compounding your interest.



**Collateral** Collateral is a pretty straightforward concept. It refers to an asset you might put down as a form of guarantee to a lender, when borrowing money frmo them. If you cannot pay back your loean, your collateral will be used to pay your debt.


In the context of DeFi, this is how things might look:


Let's say you want to borrow some assets from a protocol. For this to happen, you will need to set down a portion of your other assets as colalteral. If you don't pay your loan back, the protocol will not release your collateral back to you.



**DAO** Otherwise known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. These are organizations that are organizations governed by rules as encoded by smart contracts and controlled by its members. This is as opposed to traditional organizational models, which often tend to be governed by a small group of authority figures.

In the context of the AavegotchiDAO, what this means is that members of the ecosystem will be able to initiate and vote on proposals that will influence how the larger ecosystem will run. For instance, members might propose to increase the number of Portals available over time, amongst any other feature that they feel would help improve the community.

**DEX** Otherwise known as a Decentralized Exchange. Such platforms allow users to handle transactions in a peer-to-peer mannet, to obtain tokens through a user's own wallet with the help of smart contracts. This is as opposed to the way CEXs (Centralized Exchanges) work, which operate through a middleman (the CEX itself).


Some examples of DEXs include UniSwap, Mesa and Balancer.


Some examples of CEXs include Binance, Coinbase and OKex.


**Flash Loans** Remember what we mentioned above about loans and collaterals? Well, flash loans are a form of loan that get around that need for putting down collateral. However, there's a catch.

The flash loan has to be repaid within the same transaction block.

If this doesn't happen, the whole transaction is reversed to effectively undo the actions executed up until that point.



**Impermanent Loss** Impermanent loss occurs when you provide liquidity to a pool (see "Liquidity Pools"), and the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them. This would result in a loss if, at the point in time you wish to withdraw your assets, the price has decreased from when you first deposited them. This leads to a lower dollar value at the time of your withdrawal.



**Liquidity Pools** The term is somewhat self explanatory. These are pools of tokens that are locked in a smart contract. They are in turn used to facilitate trading by providing liquidity.

**Oracles** In order for Smart Contracts to execute, certain conditions need to be met. Information about the presence of these conditions needs to be fed to the blockchain that the contract is on. This is because blockchains typically do not have ready access to information outside of the chain. This is where oracles come into the picture. These entities provide the necessary data to trigger smart contracts.



**Smart Contracts** Generally speaking, a smart contract is a self-executing contract with the "terms of agreement" between the users of the contract being directly written into the code of the contract itself. When these predetermined terms and certain conditions are met, the contract executes.



**Staking** Staking a cryptocurrency essentially means to hold that currency, to help verify transactions and support the network. In exchange for doing so, stakers typically receive some kind of reward. In the Aavegotchi world for instance, $GHST stakers are rewarded with FRENS (points) that they can use to buy tickets and win prizes in periodic raffles.



**Yield Farming** Very simply put, yield farming is a practice that allows users to earn rewards by depositing and lending their assets in a particular protocol.

This can happen in a variety of ways, but the most common mechanism is when depositers/borrowers earn coins from a protocol, by simply staking their ERC-20 tokens and/or stable coins on its platform. Usually, these rewards are used to incentivize potential depositers and borrowers to add liquidity to a particular platform.
