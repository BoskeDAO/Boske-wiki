## 介绍

The GHST token is the base currency of the Aavegotchi realm. GHST is an ERC-20 token on which you can find more info here: https://etherscan.io/token/0x3F382DbD960E3a9bbCeaE22651E88158d2791550. Beware of any token using the same name on a different adress.




## Buy/sell mechanisms
As of today, there are 2 ways to buy GHST tokens :
<br>

<ul>
  <li>With KYC : from the bonding curve https://aavegotchi.com/curve. After completing the KYC process, you will be able to buy/sell GHST with DAI and thus directly fund the Aavegotchi development (the DAO governs how to deal with the DAI collected in the treasury). </li>
<br>
  <li>Without KYC : From an exchange, decentralised or not. You can find a list of the exchanges selling GHST here : https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aavegotchi#markets</li>
</ul>

## What can I do with the GHST token?
There are various ways to get value out of your GHST tokens :
<ul>
  <li>Summon an Aavegotchi : when mainnet launches, you might want to summon an Aavegotchi to play Aavegotchi. To do that, you need to buy a portal which will cost 100 GHST (price may change, the DAO may change it), 10 Aavegotchis will be randomly generated from which you can pick one. You can test it on https://rinkeby.aavegotchi.com/portals</li>
  <li>Buy wearables, consumables & collectibles: when mainnet launches, there willl be a shop in which you will be able to buy these using your GHST</li>
  <li>Earn raffle tickets for a chance to win wearables : stake your GHST (https://aavegotchi.com/stake) to earn FRENS, convert your FRENS to buy raffle tickets (https://aavegotchi.com/shop), get a chance to win wearables (enter your tickets in the raffle here : https://aavegotchi.com/raffle). FRENS is not an ERC-20 and thus cannot be exchanged for another cryptocurrency</li>
  <li>Earn more GHST : 80% of the GHST collected (through portals, wearable & consummables sales) will be redistributed to the Aavegotchi players. By making your Aavegotchi more unique than others (see rarity farming for more infos), by taking part in the DAO, or by playing mini-games, you will get a share of these tasty GHST.</li>
  <li>Earn ETH : you can sell a few things on the secondary market. Raffle tickets can be sold (https://opensea.io/assets/aavegotchi-frens-raffle-tickets), as well as wearables (https://opensea.io/assets/aavegotchi-wearable-vouchers) and of course Aavegotchis themselves will be saleable when mainnet launches.</li> 
  <li>Earn the REALM : Stake GHST and unlock parcel tokens within the REALM. REALM is a 2D pixelated metaverse for Aavegotchis, where Aavegotchis can encounter each other, participate in mini-games, call smart contracts, and participate in governance of the AavegotchiDAO. In addition to building out their parcel visually using a parcel editor, REALM holders will also be able to call smart contracts directly from their parcels, unlocking an entire new universe of possibilities.</li>
</ul>
