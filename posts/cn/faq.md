You can find an in-depth outline of gameplay <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/gameplay" target = "_blank">here.</a>

### 什么时候我可以得到一个Aavegotchi？

Aavegotchis will be available at mainnet launch. The [metaverse](/metaverse) will open shortly after (Q1 2021).


### 主网何时启动？
Mainnet was originally scheduled for launch on 4 January 2021. Due to high congestion on the Ethereum blockchain at that point, a community vote was put into action. The community voted for the launch of Aavegotchi on the Matic Network at a later date. The team will keep everyone updated on the new launch date when it is feasible.


### 现在你能做什么？

Right now, you can:

<ul><p style="margin-left: 2.4em"><li><b>Enter Raffles to Win Wearables:</b> Until mainnet launches, the community is holding a series of <a href="https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-raffles-a-frenly-guide-66f624c9bc60">raffles</a> where you can stake your GHST to earn FRENS. With FRENS, you can enter 
any of the remaining raffles for a chance to win unique wearables for your Aavegotchi.</li></p></ul>

<ul><p style="margin-left: 2.4em"><li><b>Do Missions to Earn Wearables:</b> You can also complete our <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/missions">Aavegotchi Missions</a> - which, after you’ve completed them all, will earn you an exclusive Aavegotchi Aagent wearable 
set.</li></p></ul>

### 我需要 KYC 来玩Aavegotchi 或拥有GHST 令牌吗？

No! You only need to do KYC if you want to buy GHST directly from the <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/curve">bonding curve.</a> You can purchase GHST <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x3f382dbd960e3a9bbceae22651e88158d2791550&outputCurrency=ETH">on Uniswap</a> without KYC, as well as <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aavegotchi#markets">on certain exchanges.</a> Meanwhile, **no KYC** is required to buy portals, <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/minigames">play games,</a> 
<a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/staking">stake GHST,</a> or for any other aspect of the Aavegotchi project itself.



### Aave需要和 Aavegotchi 做什么？

Aavegotchi began with an Aave ecosystem grant, entrusted with permission to use the Aave ghost logo. The Aavegotchi game incorporates the use of [aTokens](/atokens) as a central element of gameplay, and as of November 2020, Aave is also an [official investor](https://medium.com/aave/aave-takes-stake-in-aavegotchis-pixelcraft-studios-a136fbe475f) in Pixelcraft Studios, the team behind Aavegotchi.

## 联合曲线

### 我购买了GHST，但我在我的钱包里看不到它
After making a purchase on the bonding curve, you need to make another transaction to claim the GHST tokens. Please see the screenshot below for an example. The user has to click the "CLAIM ORDER" button for the GHST tokens to appear in their wallet.

<img src = "/faq/claim-order.png" class="bodyImage" />

### Can people frontrun the Bonding Curve?
No. When you make purchases/sales of GHST token on the bonding curve, transactions are batched along with other people's transactions before being sent to the smart contract. They are not able to bid on a lower GHST price with a higher gas fee to frontrun your purchase.

## Raffle 常见问题

See <a href="https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-raffles-a-frenly-guide-66f624c9bc60">Raffles</a> for general information on raffles.



### 买了票就意味着我可以参加抽奖吗?

No! Please be aware simply buying tickets with FRENS **does not automatically enter you into the raffle.** You need to STAKE your tickets during the 72 hour-time period that the raffle is open. This includes two transactions on the Raffle page - **approve** your tickets, **and enter** your tickets. If you’ve submitted your tickets successfully, you’ll see the number of tickets you’ve entered in the raffle on the Stats page.


### Aavegotchi商店会提供抽奖可穿戴设备吗?

No. The only time these wearables will ever be released is during the pre-launch raffles.


### 抽奖可穿戴设备很特别吗?

As far as gameplay, raffle wearables will offer the same <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/wearables">boosts</a> to your Aavegotchi as any other wearables in their rarity class (such as rare, mythical, etc).  On the <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/aavegotchi-wearable-vouchers?referrer=%252Fassets%252F0xe54891774eed9277236bac10d82788aee0aed313%252F13%252Fbid">open market</a>, whether they have more resale value due to their **pre-launch status** or **brand associations** will be determined by market demand.

### 我可以买积分吗?
No. FRENS are a way to reward our community members who staked GHST.

### 除了抽奖，积分还有别的用处吗?

No, the only thing FRENS are for is entering Aavegotchi raffles. The rest of the Aavegotchi ecosystem will be powered by GHST.

### 你怎样转帐抽奖券?
Raffle Tickets are based on the ERC-1155 standard. Currently, tokens based on this standard can be transferred using the [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) interface. Once at Opensea, connect your metamask and key in the wallet address of the recipient to transfer your raffle tickets to them.

### Will there be Raffles after Mainnet launches?
Yes, there will be additional raffles after Mainnet launches. However, they will be infrequent and would not be announced beforehand. This is to reward users who are still staking and accumulating their [FRENS](/glossary#frens) and/or raffle tickets.

## Portal FAQ

### How many portals can you buy in 1 transaction?
Each user can purchase up to 50 portals in 1 transaction. This is to prevent whales from monopolizing a huge number of portals at one ago.

### If I open a portal but do not have the atoken needed to claim the gotchi, can I come back later to claim it?
Yes, you can leave the portal opened, go acquire the specific aToken, and come back later to summon your gotchi. You do not need to prepare the aTokens beforehand.

## Gameplay FAQ


### Do higher trait scores always mean higher rarity?

Aavegotchi rarity is based on a bell curve - meaning **both extremely high and extremely low** trait scores are desirable. <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/traits">Trait scores</a> that fall in the middle of the 0-100 range are more common.

### How much does it cost to play?

Portals are expected to cost 100 GHST for the first haunt. Costs for other items like wearables, consumables and land will be announced as they’re officially released - though after game launch, [the DAO](/dao) will have the power to **adjust asset prices via governance vote**. In the meantime, you can check out what some of the open market prices currently are for certain wearables on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/aavegotchi-wearable-vouchers).

### Does changing the collateral staked affect kinship level?
No, increasing or decreasing the collateral/aToken staked in the Aavegotchi does not affect kinship level.

## Technical FAQ


### Is Aavegotchi on-chain?

All elements of the Aavegotchi game are [stored on the Ethereum blockchain](https://twitter.com/aavegotchi/status/1328548543909351429). You can read more about our unique design using the Diamond Standard [here](/glossary#diamond-standard).

### Which wallet should I use with Aavegotchi?

<a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> has by far been the best option to use with Aavegotchi according to our community’s experience. Metamask and [Arkane wallet](https://arkane.network/apps) - which will be integrating with Aavegotchi soon - also both support ERC1155 tokens, meaning you’ll be able to see all of your assets (such as wearables) in your wallet in addition to your GHST tokens.

### Will Aavegotchi run on Layer 2?

Yes! Aavegotchi plans to use [Matic](https://matic.network/) as a Layer 2 solution, integrated shortly after launch. The team selected Matic as they have a strong team, made progress on decentralization, and what appears to be a strong network effect with other NFT platforms like OpenSea.

### Do I need to migrate my Aave tokens?

Aavegotchi will work with aTokens from [Aave version 2.0](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/aave-has-officially-launched-version-2-of-its-mainnet-with-several-network-upgrades-b34fa0bd111a) - so be sure to migrate any tokens you have on version 1 before trying to claim your Aavegotchi. According to Stani, we [should have a migration tool out soon](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1334546997827809285) (before launch) :)
