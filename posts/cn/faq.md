### 什么时候我可以得到一个Aavegotchi？

Aavegotchis将会在主网启动时使用。 [元](/metaverse) 将在 (Q1 2021) 后不久打开.


### 主网何时启动？
Mainnet原定于2021年1月4日发射。 由于Ethereum 区块链当时的严重拥挤，社区投票被付诸行动。 该社区投票赞成晚些时候在Matic Network推出Aavegotchi。 小组将在可行的情况下随时向所有人通报新的发射日期。


### 现在你能做什么？

现在你可以：

<ul><p style="margin-left: 2.4em"><li><b>进入抽奖获得装备:</b> 直到Mainnet启动为止， 社区正在进行一系列 <a href="https://aavegotchi. medium. com/aavegotchi-raffles-a-frenly-guide-66f624c9bc60">的狂犬病</a> 你可以在那里与您的GHST 赚取FRENS。 和朋友一起，你可以参加剩下的抽奖活动，有机会为你的Aavegotchi赢得独特的可穿戴设备。</li></p></ul>

### 我需要 KYC 来玩Aavegotchi 或拥有GHST 令牌吗？

不！ 如果您想直接从 <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/curve">绑定曲线购买GHST，您只需要做KYC。</a> 您可以在 Uniswap上购买 GHST <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x3f382dbd960e3a9bbceae22651e88158d2791550&outputCurrency=ETH"></a> 无需了解KYC, 以及 <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aavegotchi#markets">在某些交易所。</a> 同时， **无需购买门户网站** <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/minigames">游戏，</a>

### Aave需要和 Aavegotchi 做什么？

Aavegotchi began with an Aave ecosystem grant, entrusted with permission to use the Aave ghost logo. The Aavegotchi game incorporates the use of [aTokens](/atokens) as a central element of gameplay, and as of November 2020, Aave is also an [official investor](https://medium.com/aave/aave-takes-stake-in-aavegotchis-pixelcraft-studios-a136fbe475f) in Pixelcraft Studios, the team behind Aavegotchi.

### Can aTokens staked inside an Aavegotchi get liquidated?
No. The aTokens staked inside an Aavegotchi cannot be used as collateral for borrowing on the Aave platform. Thus, such aTokens cannot get liquidated.

### What are maTokens?
maTokens are aTokens which have been transferred to the Matic Network. Like aTokens, they accrue interest over time!

## 联合曲线

### I bought GHST but I can't see it in my wallet
After making a purchase on the bonding curve, you need to make another transaction to claim the GHST tokens. Please see the screenshot below for an example. The user has to click the "CLAIM ORDER" button for the GHST tokens to appear in their wallet.

<img src = "/faq/claim-order.png" class="bodyImage" />

### Can people frontrun the Bonding Curve?
No. When you make purchases/sales of GHST token on the bonding curve, transactions are batched along with other people's transactions before being sent to the smart contract. They are not able to bid on a lower GHST price with a higher gas fee to frontrun your purchase.

## FRENS FAQ

### Can I buy FRENS?
No. FRENS are a way to reward our community members who staked GHST.

### Are FRENS used for anything besides raffles?

No, the only thing FRENS are for is entering Aavegotchi raffles. The rest of the Aavegotchi ecosystem will be powered by GHST.

### What happens to the FRENS on Mainnet after the game launches on Matic?
Your FRENS balance will be automatically transferred to Matic. FRENS on Mainnet will then become worthless.

## Raffle FAQ

See <a href="https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-raffles-a-frenly-guide-66f624c9bc60">Raffles</a> for general information on raffles.



### Does buying a ticket mean I'm entered into the raffle?

不！ Please be aware simply buying tickets with FRENS **does not automatically enter you into the raffle.** You need to STAKE your tickets during the 72 hour-time period that the raffle is open. This includes two transactions on the Raffle page - **approve** your tickets, **and enter** your tickets. If you’ve submitted your tickets successfully, you’ll see the number of tickets you’ve entered in the raffle on the Stats page.


### Will raffle wearables be available in the Aavegotchi store?

No. The only time these wearables will ever be released is during the pre-launch raffles.


### Are raffle wearables special?

As far as gameplay, raffle wearables will offer the same <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/wearables">boosts</a> to your Aavegotchi as any other wearables in their rarity class (such as rare, mythical, etc).  On the <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/aavegotchi-wearable-vouchers?referrer=%252Fassets%252F0xe54891774eed9277236bac10d82788aee0aed313%252F13%252Fbid">open market</a>, whether they have more resale value due to their **pre-launch status** or **brand associations** will be determined by market demand.


### How do you transfer raffle tickets?
Raffle Tickets are based on the ERC-1155 standard. Currently, tokens based on this standard can be transferred using the [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) interface. Once at Opensea, connect your metamask and key in the wallet address of the recipient to transfer your raffle tickets to them.

### Will there be Raffles after Mainnet launches?
Yes, there will be additional raffles after Mainnet launches. However, they will be infrequent and would not be announced beforehand. This is to reward users who are still staking and accumulating their [FRENS](/glossary#frens) and/or raffle tickets.

## Wearable FAQ

### Do I need to transfer my wearable vouchers to Matic?
No. Both claimed and unclaimed wearable vouchers will be automatically transferred to Matic Network when Aavegotchi launches.

## Portal FAQ

### How many portals can you buy in 1 transaction?
Each user can purchase up to 50 portals in 1 transaction. This is to prevent whales from monopolizing a huge number of portals at one ago.

### If I open a portal but do not have the atoken needed to claim the gotchi, can I come back later to claim it?
Yes, you can leave the portal opened, go acquire the specific aToken, and come back later to summon your gotchi. You do not need to prepare the aTokens beforehand.

### When will portals be released?
Portals will be released on Matic at early February.

## AavegotchiDAO FAQ

### How do I vote using Trust Wallet on Aragon?
As at this point, Aragon has not integrated Trust Wallet yet. An alternative solution is to import your private keys from your Trust Wallet into Metamask. Once in Metamask, you can now vote on Aragon.

See [here](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/i-need-to-export-my-trust-wallet-to-metamask-how-do-i-do-this/3194) for more information on how to do so.


## Gameplay FAQ


### Do higher trait scores always mean higher rarity?

Aavegotchi rarity is based on a bell curve - meaning **both extremely high and extremely low** trait scores are desirable. <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/traits">Trait scores</a> that fall in the middle of the 0-100 range are more common.

### How much does it cost to play?

Portals are expected to cost 100 GHST for the first haunt. Costs for other items like wearables, consumables and land will be announced as they’re officially released - though after game launch, [the DAO](/dao) will have the power to **adjust asset prices via governance vote**. In the meantime, you can check out what some of the open market prices currently are for certain wearables on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/aavegotchi-wearable-vouchers).

### Does changing the collateral staked affect kinship level?
No, increasing or decreasing the collateral/aToken staked in the Aavegotchi does not affect kinship level.

## Technical FAQ


### Is Aavegotchi on-chain?

All elements of the Aavegotchi game are [stored on the Ethereum blockchain](https://twitter.com/aavegotchi/status/1328548543909351429). You can read more about our unique design using the Diamond Standard [here](/glossary#diamond-standard).

### Which wallet should I use with Aavegotchi?

<a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> has by far been the best option to use with Aavegotchi according to our community’s experience. Metamask and [Arkane wallet](https://arkane.network/apps) - which will be integrating with Aavegotchi soon - also both support ERC1155 tokens, meaning you’ll be able to see all of your assets (such as wearables) in your wallet in addition to your GHST tokens.

### Will Aavegotchi run on Layer 2?

Yes! Aavegotchi uses [Matic](https://matic.network/) as a Layer 2 solution. The team selected Matic as they have a strong team, made progress on decentralization, and what appears to be a strong network effect with other NFT platforms like OpenSea.

### Do I need to migrate my Aave tokens?

Aavegotchi will work with aTokens from [Aave version 2.0](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/aave-has-officially-launched-version-2-of-its-mainnet-with-several-network-upgrades-b34fa0bd111a) - so be sure to migrate any tokens you have on version 1 before trying to claim your Aavegotchi. According to Stani, we [should have a migration tool out soon](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1334546997827809285) (before launch) :)

### How do I migrate to Matic?
Check out our [Matic Migration Guide](/matic).

### I have a ledger / trezor, what do I do?
You could still access Matic Network using the Trezor One. For all others, it is not possible for now. You could create a new Metamask wallet and DM @Jesse | gldnXross#6482 for help.

### Why can't I see my Matic GHST on Metamask?

Make sure you have completed two transactions: (1) approve transaction, and (2) migration from Mainnet to Matic transaction. The token address for GHST on Matic is as follows: 0x385Eeac5cB85A38A9a07A70c73e0a3271CfB54A7

### Why can't I see my LP Tokens on QuickSwap?

After you have staked your LP tokens on QuickSwap, you will not be able to see them in your wallet. Unstake them if you want to see them being reflected in your wallet.
