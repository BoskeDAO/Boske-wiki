## Halloween Costume Contest

On Friday Oct 30 (4pm UTC / 12 Noon EST / 12 Midnight SGT), the ghosts *literally* came out to parade (pun intended :P). Aagents had some fun dressing up an Aavegotchi and each 'gotchi took turns to <s>walk</s>float down the <s>cat</s>ghost walk. The community voted their favs with upvotes.
