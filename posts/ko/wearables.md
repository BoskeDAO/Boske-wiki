Wearables are an important component of the Aavegotchi game. Besides endowing your Aavegotchi with a sense of fashion, wearables also boost the Aavegotchi's traits and rarity score, enabling them to perform better in minigames, as well as in rarity farming.

This page contains detailed information about every wearable that has been confirmed in the Aavegotchi game.

Distributed via an exclusive, limited-edition Raffle in November 2020, these LINK-themed wearables celebrate Aavegotchi's partnership with Chainlink, specifically our use of Chainlink VRF to ensure that Aavegotchis have verifiable, provably random traits.
