"Psst.....you there"

The Merchant Gotchi surreptitiously beckons you over to his stall, with a glint in his eye.

"I have something aamazing for you."

The Merchant Gotchi brought out a cloth-covered object. Slowly, he pulled away the cloth. The object caught the sun's rays and shone in the bright afternoon sun.

".....A Mudgen Diamond" you whispered to yourself.

The marvellous shine caught the attention of countless bystanders.

Another Gotchi shoved in. "I'll have it!"

"NO! I'LL HAVE IT!"

This, my Frens, is the Aavegotchi Baazaar. Are you savvy enough to spot and snap up a good deal fast? Can you stand the heat of haggling your way to riches?

Come and test your mettle! Buyers and sellers alike!

## Collection Addresses

The following table displays the official smart contract addresses for the various Aavegotchi assets. Before making any purchase on any marketplace, do verify the contract of the asset you are purchasing against the relevant contract in the table below (e.g. if you are intending to purchase a Raffle Ticket, check against the Raffle Tickets contract address before proceeding).

## OpenSea Tutorial

The OpenSea tutorial is an example of how to conduct some basic due diligence before making any purchase on OpenSea. The tutorial is non-exhaustive; Raffle Tickets are used as an example. You can extend the same principle to other asset categories (e.g. Wearables, etc).

Raffle Tickets refer to the tickets that are used to participate in Aavegotchi Raffles. They come in one of 6 types: (1) Common, (2) Uncommon, (3) Rare, (4) Legendary, (5) Mythical, and (6) Godlike. Visually, they look like the following image.

<img src = "/marketplace/aavegotchi-raffle-tix.png" alt = "aavegotchi raffle tickets" class="bodyImage" />

All 6 types of Raffle tickets share the same contract address: 0x93eA6ec350Ace7473f7694D43dEC2726a515E31A

To purchase them off [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), key in the search term "aavegotchi FRENS raffle tickets" in the search bar on OpenSea. Select the same keywords that pop up from the dropdown menu (circled in red below). An alternative is to use the link to the Raffle Tickets collection on OpenSea in the [table](/posts/marketplace#collection-addresses) above.

Navigate to the type of Raffle ticket you are intending to purchase.

Using Godlike Raffle Tickets as an example, verify the following:

* The URL displays the correct contract address (circled in red below):

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/marketplace/aavegotchi-opensea-url.png" alt = "aavegotchi raffle ticket" />

* The presence of a "Verified Contract" blue tick mark next to the OpenSea collection title (circled in red below).

<img src ="/marketplace/aavegotchi-godlike-raffle-ticket.png" alt= "aavegotchi godlike raffle ticket" class="bodyImage" />

* The Chain Info subsection shows the correct contract address (circled in red below). At the left hand corner of the screen, there will be a Chain Info subsection. Expand the subsection and compare the contract address against the Raffle Tickets Contract Address (0x93eA6ec350Ace7473f7694D43dEC2726a515E31A). If they are similar, you are good to go.

## Precautions

It's not fun to spend your hard-earned money for fake assets, so when buying on Opensea and other secondary marketplaces, make sure to exercise caution. Remember, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is!

* Always double-check that the contract address for the items are coming from the correct contract addresses.
* If you're unsure about something, go to the [official Aavegotchi Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NPwnWB6), where there's always frenly Aapprentices ready to help!
