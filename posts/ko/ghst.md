## Get GHST
There are basically 2 ways to buy GHST tokens :
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aavegotchi.com/curve">From the official Aavegotchi Bonding Curve</a>. Buy here and fund directly the Aavegotchi development (the DAO governs how to deal with the DAI collected in the treasury). <i>Note: Requires KYC, and Americans and Chinese citizens cannot participate.</i>  </li>
<br>
  <li><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aavegotchi#markets">From DEXes and centralized exchanges</a>. GHST is listed on many DEXes and exchanges, including <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x3f382dbd960e3a9bbceae22651e88158d2791550">Uniswap</a>, <a href="https://www.okex.com/spot/trade/ghst-eth#type=1">OKex</a>, and <a href="https://matcha.xyz/markets/GHST">Matcha</a>. Acquiring GHST from these platforms does not require KYC, but it also does not directly support the Aavegotchi DAICO.</li>
</ul>
