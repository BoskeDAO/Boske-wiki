토크노믹스? 누가 신경쓸까? 언제 올라가는 거야?

우리가 하고 여러분도 같이 해야만 합니다. 만약 GHST (또는 이런 류의 어떠한 프로젝트) 와 같은 프로젝트에 투자를 하실 계획이라면, 이렇게 광범위한 생태계가 어떻게 작동하는지를 꼭 이해해야 합니다. 이것이야말로 종국에 우리 모두가 친구들과 함께 승리할 수 있는 방법입니다.

수익 배분과 토크노믹스에 대해 아베고치는 4가지 목표의 균형을 맞추려고 합니다.

<ul><p style="margin-left: 2.4em"><b><li> 열정적인 플레이어들과 DAO 참여자들에게 보상을 해주는, 이른바 '게임을 하며 수익을 얻는' 건강한 생태계를 만드는 것.</li></b></p></ul>
<ul><p style="margin-left: 2.4em"><b><li> GHST 토큰이 장기적인 가치 생성에 있어 강력한 토대를 갖도록 보장하는 것.</li></b></p></ul>
<ul><p style="margin-left: 2.4em"><b><li> 아베고치 Dao에서 나온 안건들이 자유롭게 집행될 수 있도록 재원을 마련하는 것 </li></b></p></ul>
<ul><p style="margin-left: 2.4em"><b><li>아베고치 개발자들을 위해 지속적으로 재정적인 보상을 제공해주는 것.</li></b></p></ul>

이제부터 여러분에게 GHST 토큰 배분에 대해 먼저 말씀드리고, 앞서 언급한 목표들이 어떻게 완수될 수 있는지 상세하게 알려드릴 것입니다. 그러니 집중하셔서 읽어주시길 바랍니다 :)

## 토큰 배분

GHST는 3단계에 걸쳐 배분되었습니다. These were the private sale, pre-sale and public bonding curve sale.


**The Private Sale**

Size: 5,000,000 GHST Price: 0.05 DAI / GHST


The private sale was held in August 2020. Anyone who performed KYC and met a 20k DAI minimum can join. The funds raised during this round were allocated to Pixelcraft Studios, the company behind Aavegotchi, to ensure the successful development of the Aavegotchi game.


**The Pre-Sale**

Size: 500,000 GHST Price: 0.1 DAI / GHST

The GHST Pre-Sale was held on 14 September 2020, with a time limit of 14 days or whenever the supply sold out, whichever came first. All Level 6 Aagents who had performed KYC by the aforementioned date were eligible to purchase GHST at this stage.

To conduct the sale, a snapshot of all Level 6 Aagents at the time was taken. This was then cross-checked with those who performed KYC. Then, a special “Verified Level 6” badge was assigned to all eligible participants in the Discord. These participants were then added to a special discord channel, where links to the presale were posted.

The funds raised here were used to bootstrap liquidity in the Token Bonding Curve reserve pool, at a reserve ratio of 100%.

Participants of the Private Sale and Pre-Sale will have their GHST tokens vested over a period of one year, beginning from the close of the Pre-Sale round. After 180 days, an initial release equivalent to roughly 50% of the total amount will be released, followed by a drip release of the remaining tokens over the next 185 days.

For more details on this, read on in the [Aavegotchi Whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/186zOapKeHNNJ9y8LIByQQ64rs0eJUlEF/view?usp=sharing) and [Community Update #4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3912694/using-markdown-how-do-i-center-an-image-and-its-caption/43691451).


**Public Bonding Curve Sale**

As our frens would say, the curve never ends! For more information on the mechanics of the curve, check out our page on the [curve](/curve).

There is no limit on the supply of GHST in this round, and no limit on the time. The price opened at 0.2 DAI/ GHST, and fluctuates along the curve. There is no lockup in this round either – tokens can be claimed straight away from the curve.

Anyone who participated in KYC and had their address whitelisted by the Aavegotchi team is able to purchase straight from the curve.

Funds raised from the Curve will be available to Pixelcraft Studios via a tap mechanism controlled by GHST token holders. More information about the mechanism can be found [here](https://fundrasing.aragon.black).


**Ecosystem Fund**

The Ecosystem fund consists of 1,000,000 GHST locked according to the same schedule as the Private and Pre-Sale rounds. Unlocked funds can be deployed via proposals made to the [AavegotchiDAO](/dao) V2.0 and above, for legitimate use cases such as funding development by non-Aavegotchi core team members, promotion and marketing of AavegotchiDao, as well as any other use case the AavegotchiDAO deems useful.


**Team Fund**

The Team Fund consists of 1,000,000 GHST locked according to the same schedule as the Private Round. However, once funds have been fully unlocked, they will be distributed according to a 3-year vesting schedule, and the remaining funds will be locked into a new vesting contract for another two years, and drip-released to the Aavegotchi core team.

Team funds are primarily used to incentivize core Aavegotchi team members to contribute with their full effort to the project, as well as to compensate external advisors.

## Revenue Sharing Overview

What happens to all the GHST spent on portals and wearables?

We've made a handy diagram that briefly breaks it down for you:
<div class="centerImageContainer">
<img class="centerImage" src="/tokenomics/ghstcircle.png" alt = "Aavegotchi tokenomics">
</div>

Read on to learn about the various allocations in more detail.


## Rarity Farming

A core  part of the Aavegotchi experience is spending time with your Gotchis and equipping them with wearables. To incentivize continuous and active engagement with the game's ecosystem, part of the revenue earned from portal sales and wearables will go towards rewarding the top rarity farmers.

To that end, **40%** of all earned GHST will be distributed back to players via player rewards.

Initially, there will be three categories of Player Rewards:

* Top 100 Rarest Aavegotchis (by [BRS](/rarity-farming#base-rarity-score))
* Top 100 [Kinship](/traits#kinship) Scores
* Top 100 [Experience (XP)](/traits#experience)

The three categories will total up to the **40%** of all GHST earned. Exact percentages for each category have not been confirmed yet and will be discussed in the AavegotchiDAO.

More categories will be added, as the game continues to develop.

These rewards will be distributed **every two weeks** via onchain snapshots.


## DAO Governance

Community governance is also a core tenet of the Aavegotchi experience. Part of the DAO's responsibilities include managing a treasury, to be used for any initiative it deems worthy. (Waifu pics, maybe?)

**10%** of revenue will initially be distributed to the DAO treasury. As the DAO continues to mature, this percentage may eventually increase. The end goal, of course, is for the DAO to grow into an entity fully capable of managing and even upgrading the protocol. While that might still be a couple of years away (Aavegotchi only started Mid 2020 after all), it's still something to look forward to.


## BURN BABY BURN

As a prelude, it would be good to get yourself acquainted with GHST's [bonding curve](/curve) and how it works. Then, the fun begins.

**33%** of all GHST earned via portal and item sales will be burned. Forever. Yes, you read that right.

This high number stems from the fact that GHST is a token with a dynamic supply. Its supply increases with demand, meaning that this high burn rate does not entail the rapid deflation of the token. That's a problem for tokens with a fixed supply.

Burning GHST is a deflationary counterbalance to the downward pressure on GHST's price, as potentially caused by giving out GHST gaming rewards in the form of GHST.

Sending GHST directly to the burn address also locks DAI within the bonding curve, creating a rising price floor for GHST. This is a net positive for all parties as it enables better liquidity for buyers and sellers on the curve (aka less slippage), lowers the circulating supply, and provides stability for the [DAICO Tap Mechanism](/curve#aavegotchi-daico).


## Development Team

Last, but most definitely not least, **17%** of revenue goes to the development team. After all, it's important to feed our devs to make sure they can focus on helping build the best DeFi x NFT experience for everyone here.

That said, we're all human here. Poorly-aligned incentives for protocol developers are a huge contributor to protocol failure, and is an issue Aavegotchi hopes to prevent.

When protocol developers are paid for their work exclusively in the native token, they are forced to sell the token to pay for expenses, leading to selling pressure and a potential “spiral of death” scenario from which the token never recovers.

However, if developers aren’t paid ANY native token, then incentives aren’t strongly aligned, leading to poor decisions being made.

The Aavegotchi bonding curve solves this problem via a separation of concerns — our community-governed Tap mechanism distributes DAI from the reserve to Pixelcraft Studios (the lead developers of Aavegotchi) every month to ensure a working budget for active development.

Additionally, Pixelcraft will also receive 17% of all GHST revenue, to be used mainly for liquidity incentives, giveaways, and other promotional activities that require GHST.



**Final Words**

One of the best parts about the crypto-verse and why you constantly see the addition of new players is this – it’s not a zero sum game. There’s the chance for all of us to make gains together, especially in a DAO. The question is, how we can best bring that about. Understanding the tokenomics of a project provides us with a good starting point.

Keep reading, and keep playing. See you on the moon soon, Aagent.
