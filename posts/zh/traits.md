Aavegotchis are born with traits. Just like how your traits define who your are as a person, an Aavegotchi's traits are important in determining their livelihood as a ghost too! These multiple traits that they possess influence their [Trait Base Rarity](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/rarity-farming#base-rarity-score), their performance in mini-games, and the [wearables](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/wearables) that they're qualified to fashion. Aavegotchis summoned from [portals](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/portals) are born with a combination of randomly-generated traits. However, the Aavegotchi’s traits can change with <a href=#level>level</a>, equipped wearables and consumables used.

## Randomly Generated Traits
Upon opening of a portal, Chainlink’s VRF random number generator function is called to assign Aavegotchis with random trait values. These trait values are distributed on a bell-curve, and each trait is assigned a value of Common, Uncommon, Rare, or Mythical, depending on its rarity. The chances of getting each trait rarity is shown in the table below:

Aavegotchis possess six traits initially, although these may be extended in the future via voting in [AavegotchiDAO](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/dao). Some traits, like the Aavegotchi's body colour (other than plain old white), will be defined by the AavegotchiDAO for every new haunt!

Unlike other games, in Aavegotchi, there is no “optimal” trait. Each attribute (except for eye shape and eye color) has different effects in different mini-games. For example, Aavegotchis with higher energy may perform well in races, but would not perform well in a meditation mini-game.

<p style="margin-left: 3.0em"><i> *Common eye colours take on the colours of the staked collateral on your Aavegotchi. i.e. orange for aDai, sky blue for aLend, purple for aETH etc. </i></p>

## Kinship
Kinship is your Aavegotchi’s feeling of loyalty towards you. Kinship is not randomly assigned, but rather starts at a fixed value upon summon and increases or decreases based on various factors, such as how long the Aavegotchi has been with the same owner, and how often the owner interacts with it.

Typically, longer ownership equals higher kinship, but neglecting your Aavegotchi for long periods of time will lower its kinship level. Aavegotchis aren’t just vessels to store your crypto bags. They’re living, breathing ghosts, and they need your affection!

High kinship levels can boost your Aavegotchi’s performance in mini-games, and may also act as a multiplier for GHST rewards on governance and [rarity farming](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/rarity-farming). Low kinship levels will have the opposite effect.

Some ways to boost your Aavegotchi’s kinship level:
<ul>
<li>Aavegotchis are born with a sense of civic duty. Bring your Aavegotchi to City Hall and let it vote in AavegotchiDAO;</li>
<li>Aavegotchis may be ghosts, but they have voracious appetites! Feed your Aavegotchi consumables to see its spooky smile;</li>
<li>Aavegotchis love trying on new clothes. Equip your Aavegotchi with new wearables to forge a lasting bond; </li>
<li>Aavegotchis love to play! Take your Aavegotchi out for a romp in the Aavegotchi [Realm](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/metaverse) and level it up playing mini-games. </li>
</ul>

## Experience
Aavegotchis receive experience (XP) for voting in AavegotchiDAO and playing mini-games. Aavegotchis can also be sacrificed to remove their collateral stake and transfer it to another Aavegotchi. The recipient Aavegotchi will receive a percentage of the sacrificed Aavegotchi’s accrued XP. Exact percentage will be determined by the AavegotchiDAO.

## Level
Aavegotchis level up as they gain more XP. Every few levels, Aavegotchis receive one Spirit Point that can be allocated towards increasing or decreasing a certain trait. Some wearables can only be worn by Aavegotchis of a certain level.

## Haunt
Like pioneers to the New World, Aavegotchis travel from the Nether Realm to the Ether Realm in groups known as Haunts. The initial Haunt contains 10,000 Aavegotchis. Thereafter, new Haunts must be approved for travel by the AavegotchiDAO. Some wearables can only be worn by Aavegotchis belonging to a certain Haunt.
