How do you summon an Aavegotchi and bring it from the Nether realm to your screen? Through a Portal, of course! Through a Portal, of course!

Peer deep into its purple depths and see what lurks beneath – you’ll find a friend. Or more specifically, 10 friends. Or more specifically, 10 friends.

So put on your wizard cap – it’s time to learn more about Portals and the Aavegotchi summoning process.

## Buying a Portal

Before you can raise your pixelated ghost baby, you’ll need to summon it via a Portal. You can acquire this either from the official Aavegotchi Dapp, or an external marketplace such as OpenSea.

If you’re purchasing it from the Aavegotchi Dapp, each portal will cost approximately 100 GHST. These devices will also be released in ‘Haunts’ (editions). The first haunt will offer 10, 000 Portals up for grabs. After this, the AavegotchiDAO will continue to vote on decisions relating to separate haunts.


## Opening your Portal

Sweet! You’ve got your hands on a portal. Select your portal under ‘My Portals, click to open it. Each portal contains 10 different Aavegotchis for you to choose from, to call forth from the Nether realm.

With the help of [Chainlink VRF](https://blog.chain.link/verifiable-random-functions-vrf-random-number-generation-rng-feature/), these Aavegotchis all bear different randomly generated traits. As you toggle through your options, you can view these traits and your Aavegotchi’s Base Rarity Score. You can check out the trait range and rarity probabilities in this table here:

More information on rarity farming can be found [here](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/rarity-farming).


## Claiming an Aavegotchi

Once you’ve decided on the Aavegotchi that you wish to stake, you need to stake the required amount of Spirit Force to the Portal. In other words, you’ll need to stake an Aave-backed ERC20 token to it, or “aTokens”. These aTokens will have to be acquired from our frens at [Aave](https://aave.com/).

In addition to their monetary value as dictated by scarcity and market forces, each Aavegotchi also has an intrinsic value. The aTokens you stake to it provide this intrinsic value. For more information on aTokens, check out the [page](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/atokens) on it.

In more technical terms, each Aavegotchi ERC721 NFT manages an escrow contract address that holds their aToken Spirit Force. aTokens generate yield via Aave’s LendingPool, which increases the quantity of aTokens held in the wallet, helping to increase the intrinsic value of your fren over time.

Generally speaking, the minimum amount of Spirit Force (collateral) depends on the Base Rarity Score of the Aavegotchi you want to summon. The higher the score, the more collateral it requires.

The minimum amount of collateral required is 10 DAI worth, while the maximum is 1000 DAI worth of collateral.


## Transferring your Aavegotchi

Transferring an Aavegotchi to a new owner (when you trade it) also transfers the staked collateral behind it, as well as any items and wearables in the Aavegotchi's inventory. This happens when you trade your Aavegotchi on an online marketplace such as OpenSea.

If you wish to retrieve the staked collateral backing your Aavegotchi, you have two options:

1. **Reduce the amount of collateral** in your Aavegotchi (but not below it's minimum stake).

2. **Burn your Aavegotchi**, releasing it back to the Nether Realm and returning all of your collateral.
