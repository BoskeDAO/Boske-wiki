Welcome to the Aavegotchi fam, fren! Our community is a vibrant group that’s crazy about Aavegotchi. We’re on several different channels, so you can find us wherever suits you best - but be sure not to miss our Discord if you want to level up to Aavegotch Aagent status! Our Aavegotchi Aagents are a central part of our community, with in-depth Aavegotchi knowledge and special Aagent wearables. Read on for more info on each of the ways you can connect with us.

Our Discord is also a great spot for anyone with general questions, not so general questions, those who need technical support, or any frens who want to just to 
pop in and chat. </p>

is currently slated for late December, so check out our <a href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/missions">missions page</a> now for more info on how to level up!
