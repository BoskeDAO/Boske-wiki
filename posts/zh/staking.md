Staking refers to the process of locking up your cryptocurrency in return for rewards. This is no different in the Aavegotchi project. The native token, [GHST](/posts/ghst), can be staked in the Staking Contract to earn [FRENS](/posts/glossary#frens).

FRENS are a non-transferable balance within the Aavegotchi Staking Contract. FRENS cannot be purchased. They are meant to reward stakers for their contributions to the Aavegotchi project.

FRENS can then be converted into Raffle Tickets, which can be entered into periodic Raffles to win prizes.

Continue reading to learn how to stake GHST and earn prizes with your FRENS.

## Purchasing GHST
First, you need to get your hands on some GHST tokens to stake. Our [GHST token page](/posts/ghst) covers the various ways in which you can get yourself some.

## How to Stake
Once you have some GHST tokens, it is time to stake them!

There are two ways to stake: (1) staking GHST tokens, and/or (2) staking Uniswap GHST-ETH LP tokens.

### Staking GHST tokens
This is the most straightforward way to stake GHST tokens. Head over to the [staking user interface](https://aavegotchi.com/stake). It will look like the image below.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/staking/staking-interface.png" alt = "aavegotchi staking" />

Select "Stake on Mainnet" and you will be presented with another page with two boxes. The box on the left will be titled "Stake GHST Token" (see image below). If you are staking for the very first time, you have to click on the "Approve" button, which grants the Staking Contract access to your GHST tokens. Once the "Approve" transaction goes through, you can then key in the desired amount of GHST you would like to stake in the "Input amount" field. When you are done, hit the "Stake" button to initiate the staking process.

*For every 1 GHST staked in this way, you receive 1 FRENS / Day.*

### Staking Uniswap GHST-ETH LP tokens
A second, and more complicated, method is to stake the Uniswap GHST-ETH Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens. To do this, you have to have both GHST tokens and ETH in your wallet. Head over to the [GHST-ETH Uniswap pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x3f382dbd960e3a9bbceae22651e88158d2791550/ETH) to add liquidity for both tokens (see image below). Users have to contribute liquidity at a ratio of 50% GHST and 50% ETH to the pool. The amount of GHST and ETH required to acquire 1 GHST-ETH LP token varies based on the price of the pool token at the time.  In return for staking both GHST and ETH, users will receive the GHST-ETH LP token from Uniswap.

Once you have acquired your GHST-ETH LP token, head to the [staking user interface](https://aavegotchi.com/stake). It will look like the image below.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/staking/staking-interface.png" alt = "aavegotchi staking" />

Select "Stake on Mainnet" and you will be presented with another page with two boxes. The box on the right will be titled "Stake Uniswap GHST Token" (see image below). If you are staking for the very first time, you have to click on the "Approve" button, which grants the Staking Contract access to your GHST-ETH LP tokens. Once the "Approve" transaction goes through, you can then key in the desired amount of GHST-ETH LP tokens you would like to stake in the "Input amount" field. When you are done, hit the "Stake" button to initiate the staking process.

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/staking/stake-uniswap-ghst-eth.png" alt = "stake uniswap ghst-eth LP token aavegotchi" />

*For every 1 GHST-ETH staked in this way, you receive 100 FRENS / Day.*

Why the huge difference in the number of FRENS earned through this method? Staking GHST-ETH LP tokens has the risk of [impermanent loss](/posts/glossary#impermanent-loss). You are compensated for the increased risk you take.

## Purchasing Raffle Tickets

Once you have enough FRENS, head to the [Shop Bulk Buy user interface](https://aavegotchi.com/bulk-buy) to purchase raffle tickets with FRENS.

There are six different levels of raffle tickets:

## Entering Raffles

A raffle runs for a period of time. During this period, you can submit your raffle tickets for a chance to win prizes. When the raffle is over, you can find out what prizes you have won and can claim them. If you choose not to participate in a given Raffle, this option is also possible. You can accumulate Raffle Tickets for subsequent Raffles if you like to do so.

The first raffle (Chainlink Theme) started on 10 November 2020 and ran for 3 days. Here were the prizes for the raffle:

<img class = "bodyImage" src = "/staking/link-raffle-prizes.png" alt = "Chainlink Aavegotchi Raffle Prizes" />

A total of 6010 prizes.

Winning prizes depends on which tickets and how many tickets you enter into a raffle, how many prizes there are, and how many tickets other people submit.

The raffle utilizes Chainlink's [on-chain verifiable randomness](https://blog.chain.link/verifiable-random-functions-vrf-random-number-generation-rng-feature/) to determine prize winners.

The prizes, which are Wearable Vouchers, could be exchanged 1:1 for the actual Aavegotchi wearable once the game launches. This will take place at the [Aavegotchi Shop](https://aavegotchi.com/shop).
