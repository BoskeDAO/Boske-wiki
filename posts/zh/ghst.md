## Get GHST
There are basically 2 ways to buy GHST tokens :
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aavegotchi.com/curve">From the official Aavegotchi Bonding Curve</a>. Buy here and fund directly the Aavegotchi development (the DAO governs how to deal with the DAI collected in the treasury). <i>Note: Requires KYC, and Americans and Chinese citizens cannot participate.</i>  </li>
<br>
  <li><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aavegotchi#markets">From DEXes and centralized exchanges</a>. GHST is listed on many DEXes and exchanges, including Uniswap, OKex, and Matcha. Acquiring GHST from these platforms does not require KYC, but it also does not directly support the Aavegotchi DAICO.</li>
</ul>
