GHST token is the eco-governance token of the Aavegotchi Universe. GHST is minted by depositing DAI into a [bonding curve](/posts/curve). As long as Ethereum exists, it will be possible to convert GHST back into DAI by interacting with the curve.

GHST is an ERC-20 token running on the ethereum blockchain at the address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x3F382DbD960E3a9bbCeaE22651E88158d2791550">0x3F382DbD960E3a9bbCeaE22651E88158d2791550</a>.  Be cautious to follow the guidelines below and refer to this exact address when gettin some.

## Get GHST
There are basically 2 ways to buy GHST tokens :
  * [From the official Aavegotchi Bonding Curve](https://aavegotchi.com/curve). Buy here and fund directly the Aavegotchi development (the DAO governs how to deal with the DAI collected in the treasury). <i>Note: Requires KYC, citizens from the United States & China cannot participate.</i>  * [From DEXes and centralized exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aavegotchi#markets). GHST is listed on many DEXes and exchanges, including <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x3f382dbd960e3a9bbceae22651e88158d2791550">Uniswap</a>, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/trade/GHST_ETH?layout=pro">Binance</a>, <a href="https://www.okex.com/spot/trade/ghst-eth#type=1">OKex</a>, and <a href="https://matcha.xyz/markets/GHST">Matcha</a>. Acquiring GHST from these platforms does not require KYC, but it also does not directly support the Aavegotchi DAICO.

Although most Ethereum wallets will allow you to buy GHST, it is recommended to use [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). If your GHST does not display in Metamask, follow this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vePRtkt5Bu0) to add it. Beware of smart contract wallets which may not be fully compatible with staking or other functions.


## Use GHST
GHST is the eco-governance token of the Aavegotchi Universe. When Aavegotchi launches on Mainnet, players will spend GHST to buy [portals](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/portals), [wearables](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/wearables), and [REALM parcels](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/metaverse).

Here are all the current and future uses for GHST:

  * **Earn raffle tickets for a chance to win wearables:** [Stake your GHST](https://aavegotchi.com/stake) to earn FRENS, [Convert your FRENS](https://aavegotchi.com/shop) to raffle tickets, Enter the [raffle](https://aavegotchi.com/raffle) and pray to the holy VRF frog to be as lucky as [this anon](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/anon-and-the-green-ticket-5776969b3a69).

  * **Earn ETH:** Our frens at [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) have made things easy for you to buy and sell NFTs. Raffle tickets can be [sold](https://opensea.io/assets/aavegotchi-frens-raffle-tickets), Wearables can be [sold](https://opensea.io/assets/aavegotchi-wearable-vouchers), and of course Aavegotchis themselves will be saleable.

  * **Soon... summon an Aavegotchi.** You might want to summon an Aavegotchi to play Aavegotchi. Buy a portal and chose 1 out of 10 Aavegotchis randomly generated. The initial price set for a portal is 100 GHST. As always, players will decide [through the DAO](/posts/dao) if this is a fair price. Mainnet sooooon, [test it](https://testnet.aavegotchi.com/portals) on Kovan.

  * **Soon... dress your Aavegotchi.** Your Aavegotchi has high fashion standards, make it feel special and it will give it back to you. It is pretty likely that Aavegotchis with the rarest traits and wearables will be the most valuable.

  * **Soon... enhance the [REALM](/posts/metaverse).** Stake GHST and unlock parcel features within the REALM. REALM is a 2D pixelated metaverse for Aavegotchis, where Aavegotchis can encounter each other, participate in mini-games, call smart contracts, and participate in governance of the AavegotchiDAO. In addition to building out their parcel visually using a parcel editor, REALM holders will also be able to call smart contracts directly from their parcels, unlocking an entire new universe of possibilities.



## Earn GHST
All the GHST collected through sales (portals, wearables, parcels, consumables & collectibles) will be split in two cakes. Cake 1 will reward the Aavegotchi players. Cake 2 will be burnt, which is not really tasty but is [awesome for the token value!](https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/769205560222285844/776545843607896074) It is estimated that 80% of GHST will flow into cake 1 at launch (of course the DAO will chose how to adjust), here are ways to earn your share:

 * **[Become an Aagent](https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/737923459061121044/738035042399551569)**. Every time you successfully complete a Mission, your Role in the Aavegotchi Discord increases by one. When Aavegotchi launches on Mainnet (announced for December 2020), Mission participants will be entered into giveaways for Aavegotchi swag, including $GHST tokens, fab wearables, and consumables. Each Level will have its own giveaway, so the higher your level, the more chances you’ll have!

* **[Become an exemplary Aagent](https://discord.com/invite/NPwnWB6)**. Our beloved Aavegotchi founders have always rewarded the Aagents that went the extra mile. Have a look at the Discord discussions, there may be some activity that will stick to your skills.

* **Soon... bored with yield farming? Try rarity farming!** The rarest your Aavegotchi, the more GHST rewards you will get back. Read the [aawesome article](/posts/rarity-farming) for more details.

* **Soon... [Participate in the DAO](/posts/dao)**. Wondering what a DAO is? It stand for Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, meaning that the GHST token holders will govern the Aavegotchi realm. More to be announced soon, but the general idea is that the more active a player is in the governance process, the more rewards he/she/it will get.

* <b>Soon... play mini-games.</b> Not much has been announced so far about this, we know the DAO will be the first mini-game
