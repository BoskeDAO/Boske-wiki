If you've just begun exploring the world of DeFi, welcome to this part of the internet! This section of the Aavegotchi wiki will hopefully provide you with some information that will help you wrap your head around some DeFi basics, and in turn make the most out of your time in the Aavegotchi universe.


When you're done reading this and hopefully have a basic understanding of DeFi, feel free to hop over to the ONBOARDING SECTION LINK HERE and put your newfound knowledge to use.

## Introduction

"DeFi" stands for **De**centralized **Fi**nance. It can be thought of as an ecosystem of applications and protocols that provide similar services to traditional financial institutions (ie, lending, borrowing, and accruing interests from saving, amongst others). However, there is one key difference - DeFi aims to do this in a decetralized manner with no middle man.


That means no banks taking a cut of your potential returns or providing you with negative interest rates. That also means no central point of failure where the entire system could collapse, or be subjected to a set of rules decided and implemented by a small group with concentrated power.


At the time of writing (December 5 2020), the Total Value Locked in Defi stands at 14.24B USD.


## Common Applications and Use Cases

## Terms

**Aggregators** placeholder



**APY** APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. This is the real rate of return earned on the savings you have deposited into a protocol, taking into account the effect of compounding your interest.



**Collateral** Collateral is a pretty straightforward concept. It refers to an asset you might put down as a form of guarantee to a lender, when borrowing money frmo them. If you cannot pay back your loean, your collateral will be used to pay your debt.

In the context of DeFi, this is how things might look:

Let's say you want to borrow some assets from a protocol. For this to happen, you will need to set down a portion of your other assets as colalteral. If you don't pay your loan back, the protocol will not release your collateral back to you.



**DAO** Otherwise known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. These sdflskdjf



**DEX** Otherwise known as a Decentralized Exchange. Such platforms allow users to . This is as opposed to the way CEXs (Centralized Exchanges) work, by__.

Some examples you may have heard of include UniSwap, Balancer and Kyber, amongst others.


**Flash Loans** Remember what we mentioned above about loans and collaterals? Well, flash loans are a form of loan that get around that need for putting down collateral. However, there's a catch.

The flash loan has to be repaid within the same transaction block.

If this doesn't happen, the whole transaction is reversed to effectively undo the actions executed up until that point.



**Oracles** placeholder



**Smart Contracts** Generally speaking, a smart contract is a self-executing contract with the "terms of agreement" between the users of the contract being directly written into the code of the contract itself. When these predetermined terms and certain conditions are met, the contract executes.

Smart contracts are commonly used in DeFi for a whole range of purposes. These include



**Staking** placeholder



**Underlying Assets** Placeholder



**Yield Farming** Very simply put, yield farming is a practice that allows users to earn rewards by depositing and lending their assets in a particular protocol.

This can happen in a variety of ways, but the most common mechanism is when depositers/borrowers earn coins from a protocol, by simply staking their ERC-20 tokens and/or stable coins on its platform. Usually, these rewards are used to incentivize potential depositers and borrowers to add liquidity to a particular platform.
